# GetItTogether
This is a mobile app that uses a machine learning algorithm to find the optimal, logically sound schedule for the user. They can save the schedule, make notes for themselves on reminders, new ideas, or whatever they like. It works on iOS, Android, and Windows.

The user inputs in date, time, and short memo about a task they want to do. Be it school related, work related, personal related, or those combined. 

The algorithm generates the optimal schedule by having the user enter in how important the task is to them, when it's due, how long it might take, and if it's school related, how much of their grade does it affects. Some of these inputs are optional. Then it uses a genetic algorithm which is an optimizer algorithm, to find and generate the best schedule for the user to follow. Based on logic and math. 

# Why I Made This

When I have a lot to do I always find myself trying to figure out what succession of tasks need to be completed so I have the best outcome for my time and work. For example, if I have an important project due tomorrow, but another project due tonight that isn't as important, and something personal related, what should I do to get the best outcome. (I.e. semester GPA, job performance, etc). I personally want a logical, mathematical model to help me figure out what is the best thing for me to do. How can I get the best overall semester GPA. How can I balance work and school. Personal life and work. 

This app will use mathematics to help me figure that out. Now this isn't the end all be all. Rather it is a second head. Something that can help me figure out what to do. A program thats output is fast and optimal.

I built this app for myself. But I feel like there may be other people like me with the same mindset that needs a second head. So, I developed ...
